    <p>Here are few of my favorite pieces from my beauty blog</p>

<p>Rare Beauty</p>
    <p>Looking for a brand that cares about the well being of others. Well if that is the case I have some good news for you! Rare Beauty by Selena Gomez is challenging mental health stigma with her beauty line. She wants to change the way people view beauty. Her brand donates 1% of every sale to the Rare Impact fund which helps people get access to resources that can aid their mental health. Rare Beauty is not only changing the way we do beauty, they also have some amazing products! Here are some of my favorites.</p>
    <p>The Liquid Touch Brightening Concealer. This lightweight concealer has great coverage and really helps brighten the under-eyes in the morning or for a night out in the city or town! There is a variety of shades for everybody.</p>
    <p>The Positive Light Tinted Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 20 Sunscreen. This product is a holy grail it has everything you need in one bottle. You get to moisturize and protect your face from the sun while giving it a light tint. This product is great for those who want a small amount of coverage. Great for the morning when you are rushing and want to look put together.</p>
    <p>Lastly, the Always An Optimist 4-In-1 Mist. This mist is also a holy grail! You can prime your skin preparing it for makeup, set your makeup, or simply refresh your bare skin or makeup through out the day! Plus, it has an amazing smell to it, it reminds me of a Vanilla Chai Tea Latte!</p>
    <p>LA ROCHE POSAY EFFACLAR helping prevent acne. </p>
    <p>LA ROCHE POSAY EFFACLAR acne medicated cleanser, is another holy grail product I found during the pandemic. As I have mentioned before, I had really bad acne when the Covid-19 pandemic began. I had tried so many things and almost none worked. I came across this cleanser while out at Target wearing a mask of course! I started using this cleanser everyday and within a week I could see a big difference with my acne. My pimples had shrunk in size and the redness on my face was fading slowly. Even now that my acne has cleared up I still keep one of these in my bathroom to prevent any acne. I will say this cleanser is on the heavy side of chemicals so I do recommend taking small breaks from it if your acne is not as bad. I tend to just use mine at night time and in the morning I use a more gentle cleanser. So, if you are currently going through some acne issue give it a try, I promise it won&rsquo;t disappoint.&nbsp;</p>
